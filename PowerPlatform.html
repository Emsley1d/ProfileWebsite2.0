        <h1>Power Platform Products</h1>

        <p>I particularly enjoy working with Microsofts Power Platform.</p>

        <h4>The below are just a selection of Power Apps I have created whilst working at Springboard IT.</h4>

        <div id="holidayApp-container" class="app-container">

            <h2>HOLIDAY REQUEST APP</h2>

            <p>An app for requesting, editing, viewing and accepting/rejecting holiday requests.</p>

            <p>The app is in use at multiple companies, the largest having 70+ employees. Holiday balances are by the hour and the app caters for different shift patterns and rota days.</p>
            <p>The app features login functionality (via a pin/password set by each employee). This helps differentiate between multiple users using one email address (for example workshop@) and helps catalogues users as either a Team Member or Team manager.</p>
            <p>Members can request holiday and edit or view their holiday requests. In addition, Managers can accept/reject holiday requests and view holiday for their specific team (or if part of higher managements/HR) the whole company.</p>
            <p>All holiday data is held in SharePoint, with accepted holiday requests appearing on a Calendar view which is also visible in the Company's Microsoft Teams (where the app is also embedded).</p>

            <h4>Power Automate</h4>

            <p>There are multiple flows in Power Automate:</p>

            <ul>
                <li>
                    On submit of a holiday request (and the request being patched to a SharePoint list) a flow ascertains who an individual's manager is and emails them details of the request, with accept/reject options.
                    <br>
                    If accepted:
                        <ul>
                            <li>
                            An email is sent to the requestee confirming their holiday has been approved, the request is updated to accepted in SharePoint, and it appears on the Calendar view.
                            </li>
                        </ul>

            <p>The app is use at one company but across a number of their sites.</p>
            <p>A user simply enters their unique pin to clock in or out; if a user isn't currently clocked in they are done so upon input of their pin and vice versa if they are already clocked in at the point of entering their pin.</p>

            <h2>AGGREGATE REPORTING APP</h2>

            <p>This Power App has been designed as a reporting application, bringing together data from seven separate SharePoint lists into a single, easy-to-use view. By consolidating this information in one place, users can quickly understand the overall picture without needing to navigate between multiple systems or lists.</p>
            <p>The customer already uses a suite of Power Apps as part of their day-to-day processes. For that reason, the reporting solution was deliberately built as a Power App, rather than a standalone Power BI report. This ensures a consistent user experience, keeps everything within the same Microsoft 365 ecosystem, and allows the report to sit naturally alongside existing applications and workflows.</p>
 
            <h4>Power Automate</h4>
            
            <p><p>The report can be exported to PDF on demand using a simple button within the app. When the export button is clicked, it triggers a Power Automate flow that generates a PDF version of the report and automatically sends it to the intended recipient via email. This makes it easy to share up-to-date, formatted reports with stakeholders who may not have access to the app itself.</p>
