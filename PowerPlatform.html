            <h2>HOLIDAY REQUEST APP</h2>

            <p>An app for requesting, editing, viewing and accepting/rejecting holiday requests.</p>

            <p>The app is in use at multiple companies, the largest having 70+ employees. Holiday balances are by the hour and the app caters for different shift patterns and rota days.</p>
            <p>The app features login functionality (via a pin/password set by each employee). This helps differentiate between multiple users using one email address (for example workshop@) and helps catalogues users as either a Team Member or Team manager.</p>
            <p>Members can request holiday and edit or view their holiday requests. In addition, Managers can accept/reject holiday requests and view holiday for their specific team (or if part of higher managements/HR) the whole company.</p>
            <p>All holiday data is held in SharePoint, with accepted holiday requests appearing on a Calendar view which is also visible in the Company's Microsoft Teams (where the app is also embedded).</p>

            <h4>Power Automate</h4>

            <p>There are multiple flows in Power Automate:</p>

                <li>On submit of a holiday request (and the request being patched to a SharePoint list) a flow ascertains who an individuals manager is and emails them details of the request; with accept/reject options.<br>
                If accepted: <ul>
                            <li>An email is sent to the requestee confirming their holiday has been approved, the request is updated to accepted in SharePoint and appears on the Calendar view.</li>

            <h2>TIMESHEET/LOCATION REGISTER APP</h2>

            <p>The app enables employees to clock in and out when arriving at different offices and acts as a site register; in the event of a fire etc.</p>

            <p>The app is use at one company but across a number of their sites.</p>
            <p>A user simply enters their unique pin to clock in or out; if a user isn't currently clocked in they are done so upon input of their pin and vice versa if they are already clocked in at the point of entering their pin.</p>
