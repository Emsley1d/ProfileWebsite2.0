                    three and focused
                    predominantly on the Front End; linking an external API with an Axios request; the
                    overall design and user
                    interface as well as presenting the project.</p>

                focused on intergrating the Cat model and it's CRUD functionality, user image upload via

                The project was built using; HTML, CSS, JavaScript, jQuery, Express (including CRUD and
                Authentication),
                API CRUD, Middleware, MongoDB and Mongoose.
